This project was presented at the [DARIAH Annual Event 2023](https://www.dariah.eu/2022/12/14/dariah-annual-event-2023-call-for-papers-now-open/) as an example of reuse of digital collections based on Spanish Golden Age theatre in the form of a poster entitled "Named Entity Recognition and Knowledge Extraction from Spanish Golden Age theatre"

## Introduction
This work was performed in collaboration with master students at the [University of Alicante](https://www.ua.es/) to annotate a selection of [TEI](https://tei-c.org/) works provided by the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes. [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) was used as an external repository to enrich the text by using organizations, people, locations, and deities and mythical creatures.
